# Remaining issues after wave 21

## AI Behavior

#### our AI behavior is way off from where it was before as far as yielding high scoring action packed computer demos.  

## Player control

#### Non-coordinator player characters flicker in and out, maybe aren't oriented / coordinated properly in game state updates, events.

## Game state issues

#### Rebounding scrambles don't resolve.

## Gameplay issues
#### rebounds off jump shots never resolve to a player leading to 24 second violations

#### caroms when players are shove never resolve posession so a 24 second violation will happen

#### players can rebound missed dunks however, and they are missing every dunk they attempt.

#### players are making zero percent of their dunks whereas they should be making a large percentage of them

#### players don't seem to take jump shots or layups only 3 poitners and dunks.

#### players no longer seem to pick up their dribble after 5 seconds or go through the decision making process when trapped in that situation

## Rendering issues

#### No visual feedback on shot arcs 
observed in demo mode.  probably exists other places

#### Dunk mutliplayer rendering not implemented

## Multiplayer specific

#### Non-coordinator player characters flicker in and out, maybe aren't oriented / coordinated properly in game state updates, events.

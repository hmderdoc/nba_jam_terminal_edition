persistent progression, economy, and social features that tie into the arcade 
gameplay.

## LORB CAREER MODE FEATURES

### CHARACTER CREATION

Build your baller from the ground up:

- Choose from 5 unique archetypes:
  * The Slasher - Attack the rim with reckless abandon
  * The Sniper - Ice in your veins, you live beyond the arc
  * The Enforcer - Dominate the paint, make them fear the lane
  * The Playmaker - Court vision, you see plays before they happen
  * The Underdog - Nothing given, everything earned

- Select your background story that shapes your starting situation
- Customize your appearance: skin tone, jersey colors, nametag style
- Pick your jersey number

Each archetype has unique stat bonuses and a special passive ability that 
affects your career earnings, XP gains, or opponent performance.


### RIM CITY LOCATIONS

Navigate a living city with distinct locations:

THE HUB - Central district where you start each day. Check your status, see

rewards:

  * Dunk District - Dunkers rule here, big rewards for the bold
  * The Arc - Sniper's haven, shooters only
  * Court of Airness - The ultimate challenge, where the Red Bull waits

Beat opponents to earn cash, rep, and XP. Higher courts mean tougher 
competition but bigger payouts. Sometimes an NBA legend shows up for a game.

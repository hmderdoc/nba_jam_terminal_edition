## Outstanding Questions

1. **What is the long-term plan for the trail overlay?** Jump indicators now require `trailFrame`. Should all transient effects (fire trails, inbound highlights, path indicators) move there as well, and should we add instrumentation to fail fast if the frame can’t be created?
2. **Can the betting UI expose prompts selectively?** `GAME_MODE_CONSTANTS.BETTING.promptsEnabled` is global. Do we want prompts during demos only (`nba_jam.js` now calls `showMatchupScreen(true, …)` for CPU demos) while keeping them hidden elsewhere? If so, the config probably needs per-mode switches instead of a single boolean.
3. **How should multiplayer failover rehydrate sprite mappings?** `mp_coordinator.setPlayerSpriteMap` assumes it runs once per session. If a new coordinator takes over mid-game, do we have a canonical source for the map, or should it rebuild from authoritative state snapshots?
4. **Should shot-clock pauses block the entire simulation?** Right now shot-clock violations call `frameScheduler.waitForNextFrame(1000)` inside the authoritative loop. That halts AI and input collection, which can desync multiplayer clients. Would a non-blocking pause (e.g., storing a “violation timeout” and returning early from `runGameFrame`) be safer?
5. **Are we comfortable with the predictive collision thresholds?** The client guard (dx/dy < 1.5) diverges from the authoritative 2×2 collision window. If we ever resize sprites or change hitboxes, we must update both locations. It might be safer to export the threshold from `PLAYER_CONSTANTS`.
6. **How do we expose state manager changes for analytics?** `stateManager.set` accepts a `reason` string, but there’s no structured way to stream those events to telemetry. Should we add a debug hook or event bus subscription that forwards all state changes when `DEBUG_STATE_STREAM` is enabled?
